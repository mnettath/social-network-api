# social-network-api

## Description

I created this API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database. This API allows my website to handle large amounts of unstructured data. While working on this project, I familiarized myself with MongoDB and Mongoose. I had not worked with these two technologies prior. Creating the models were slightly different compared to using a mySQL database. I also modularized my code differently than I normally do. I separated my code by controllers and routes. I found that breaking down my code this way helped me find and troubleshoot errors faster.

## Installation

In order to use this social-network-api, the user must install node.js. Node.js can be installed using this link: https://nodejs.org/en/download. It's important to download the LTS option for the computer's operating system. Next, the user can run an "npm i" in the command line to import node_modules. This will allow them to use the dependencies listed in the package.json.
